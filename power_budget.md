500kJ battery (12V 12Ah)
350kJ Assume 70% efficiency (battery wear + power loss).

Minimum operation time: 2h
Maximum power consumption (when all is full power): 50W


Power Budget: (With 2 Li-ion batteries parallel: 12V 400Ah (240A continuous) - 17.28MJ
Want 8 hours operation: 600W budget

Power Consumption:					Idle		Full
RPi 3B+								1.9W		5.1W
Intel Realsense Camera D435i		-			3.675W
Pneumatic air compressor x2			-			552W

Air flow rate (with 2 compressors @ 200 PSI): 3.6 CFM
piston * (4/leg * 6leg) = 24 pistons
24 pistons * 2 discharge/sec * ? CFP = ? CFM


Weight Budget: 25,000g ?
RPi 3B+
Intel Realsense Camera D435i		    75 g
2 Li-ion batteries parallel			50,000 g
